Each heptagon represents a week of time. Within each heptagon are triangles that represent one day. The degree of red fill for each triangle represents how much time has passed."

My overall research question was 'How can we improve the amenities at the Seattle Public Library to better serve young adults?'. The specific method I used was 'deep hanging out'. This meant that instead of making pure observations, I had defined particular focal points that I would observe in regards to library users and their interactions. These included the built environment, media consumption, possesions carried, general demographic of users and where they went for assistance. I also made sure to keep a distance from the users I was observing in order to avoid making them uncomfortable. My observations also focused only interactions and visible behavior without involving any identifying characteristics or personal details."

At the end I provide my own alternate proposal for a new music notation system (photographed above). I chose to look at music notation because I thought it would interesting to analyze a digital technology from an older time. For the assignment we used Benjamin Peter's (a prominent media scholar) definition of digital which is anything that counts the symbolic, indexes the real and once combined and coordinated, manipulates the social imaginary."
